          "p",it can be any,like strong,h,*(for all),and then in the brackets set the properties and values.The color can 
          be set via 3 ways:1)name of the color 2)rgb and 3)#007FFF.In font-family part,we set different fonts by decreasing
          priority, sans-serif is the default of Windows.If the name of the font consists of 2 or more words, the name must be
          written in quotes, like "Arial Bold". For font-size we can use different values, such as x-small,xx-large,or larger(
          it is relative to the surrounding parent element). For text-transform there are several alternatives such as uppercase,
          capitalize,none and etc.Font-size can also be set via percentage and em.200%=2em,100%=1em.-->

the dimensions of the image via  style here as well.-->

<!--"a" stands for anchor.It is used to reference a different website,i.e it is a hyperlink.In target part we write _blank or _self,
the first is to open the link in another tab, the second-in the same window.The text after target zone is shown on the page as button
to click and go to the url.Url used from internet are external paths.Besides them we have also relative paths which link to content
on private computers.If the file is in the same folder as our HTML file, we just copy and paste the link to the file,e.g 
"C:\Users\Imran\Desktop\HTML", and important, do not forget change slashs to forward ones "C:/Users/Imran/Desktop/HTML".If the file is
located in one directory upper, we add ../ "../C:/Users/Imran/Desktop/HTML", if two directories upper - ../../-->



<button type="button" onclick="alert('Hello world!')">Click Me!</button>
<!--This tag,as its name implies,adds the button.Onclick part sets the text which appears when we click the button,this part is 
not mandatory.Inside the button tag we have the text which is written on the button-->
